    <h2 style="color: red; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;" >Pakistan’s Imran Khan to face charges of exposing official secrets: Minister
</h2>
    <h4 style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif; margin-left: 10px;">The case is related to diplomatic correspondence which Khan said early last year was part of a US conspiracy to topple his government.</h4>
    <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\CN4012\Irfankhan.jpg">
    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Pakistan will open criminal proceedings against former prime minister Imran Khan on charges of exposing official secrets, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said on Wednesday.

        The case is related to diplomatic correspondence which Khan said early last year was part of a US conspiracy to topple his government.
        
        Washington has denied being involved in any such conspiracy.
        
        Pakistan’s embattled former PM had earlier accused the powerful military and its intelligence agency of openly trying to destroy his political party, saying he had “no doubt” he would be tried in a military court and thrown in jail.
        
        Meanwhile, Pakistan’s ruling coalition is all set to dissolve parliament and hand over the reins to a caretaker government next month four days before it is constitutionally required to do so, in preparation for a general election by November, local media reported on Tuesday.
        
        The elections are approaching after months of political and economic turmoil, with uncertainly even to the extent that the vote might be delayed for at least one year.
        
        Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's coalition took over after his predecessor, Imran Khan, was ousted in a vote of no confidence in parliament in April 2022.
        
        Ever since then, Khan has been campaigning for a snap election, organising protests across the country and raising tensions with the powerful military, which Khan accuses of plotting against him.

        <h2 style="color: red; text-align: center;" >Key Russian bridge to Crimea is struck again, with Moscow blaming Kyiv for attack that killed 2</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\CN4012\Russia.jpg">
   <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 25px;">   An attack before dawn Monday damaged part of a bridge linking Russia to Moscow-annexed Crimea that is a key supply route for Kremlin forces in the war with Ukraine. Russia accused the United States on Thursday of being behind what it says was a drone attack on Moscow’s Kremlin citadel intended to kill President Vladimir Putin.

    A day after blaming Ukraine for what it called a terrorist attack, the Kremlin administration shifted the focus onto the United States, but without providing evidence to support its accusation.
    
    Ukraine has denied involvement in the incident in the early hours of Wednesday, when video footage showed two flying objects approaching the Senate Palace inside the Kremlin walls and one exploding with a bright flash.
    
    “Attempts to disown this, both in Kyiv and in Washington, are, of course, absolutely ridiculous. We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,” said Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov.
    
    He said the United States was “undoubtedly” behind the alleged attack and added - again without stating evidence - that Washington often selected both the targets for Ukraine to attack, and the means to attack them.
    
    “This is also often dictated from across the ocean. We know this well and are aware of this ... In Washington they must clearly understand that we know this.”
    
    Russia has said with increasing frequency that it sees the United States as a direct participant in the Ukraine war, intent on inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Moscow. The United States denies that, saying it is arming Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s
    
    invasion and retake territory that Moscow has seized illegally in more than 14 months of war.
    
    Calls to kill Zelenskiy
    
    However, Peskov’s allegation that the United States was behind a plot to kill Putin went further than previous Kremlin accusations against Washington.
    
    Putin was not in the Kremlin at the time, and security analysts have poured scorn on the idea that the incident was a serious assassination attempt.
    
    But Russia has said it reserves the right to retaliate, and hardliners including former president Dmitry Medvedev have said it should now “physically eliminate” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
    
    Peskov declined to say whether Russia saw Zelenskiy as a legitimate target.
    
    He said Russia had an array of options and the response, when it came, would be carefully considered and balanced. He said an urgent investigation was under way, but could not say when the results would be known.
    
    Putin was in the Kremlin on Thursday and staff were working normally, he said.
    
    The incident took place less than a week before Russia’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two - an important public holiday and an opportunity for Putin to rally Russians behind what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine.
    
    Peskov said air defences would be tightened, and this was happening anyway for the military parade on Red Square, the centrepiece of the holiday, just over the Kremlin wall from the site of the alleged attack.
    
    He said the parade would go ahead as normal, and include a speech from the president.
