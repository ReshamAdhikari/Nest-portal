    <h2 style="color: red; text-align: center;">Minister says Education Act a priority. Others said so and did nothing

 </h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\CN4012\SCHOOL.jpg"  width="400px" height="300px" style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
       
       <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 25px;"> 
        Minister for Education, Science and Technology Ashok Rai on Wednesday claimed that promulgation of the Federal Education Act was the present government’s top priority.

This was hardly an original claim as his predecessors had asserted the same. Speaking before the Education and Health Committee of the House of Representatives, Rai said the Cabinet was in final discussions to endorse the bill before presenting it in Parliament.

“It would be registered in the House if the secretary and joint-secretary were not on leave,” he said. “Promulgation of the bill is one of the top priorities of the government.”

Rai said the Cabinet will endorse the bill once the education secretary and a joint-secretary who are abroad to attend a conference return home.

Education Secretary Ram Krishna Subedi also claimed at a function on Friday that the bill was being discussed in the Cabinet, which will give it a final shape. Rai is the sixth education minister since the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal. Like him, all his predecessors had listed formulation of the law as their top-most priority.

However, none of them could promulgate the Act, which is one of the laws crucial for a full-fledged implementation of federalism institutionalised by the constitution.

The constitution has delegated all the authority to manage school education to the local units. An Act and regulations are prerequisites to the implementation of the constitutional provision. In the absence of the law, local governments have not been able to exercise their constitutional authority.

“It has been eight years since the constitution authorised the local government to manage entire school education but because there is no law, we haven’t been able to exercise the authority fully,” said Bhim Prasad Dhungana, president of the Municipal Association Nepal who is also the mayor of Neelkantha Municipality in Dhading.

The constitution empowers local governments to make laws. However, the charter also says such laws will be void to the extent they contradict the federal law. On several occasions in the past, the federal government has issued circulars to the local governments ordering them not to make laws until related federal Acts are formulated. A writ petition challenging the circular is sub judice in the Supreme Court.

Local representatives say the primary reason behind the delay in issuing the law is the federal government’s reluctance to delegate authority to local governments. The bureaucracy is also complicit in the delay, they say. They claim lack of a constitutional deadline for the promulgation of the laws like the one related to the fundamental rights is also responsible.

The constitution made it mandatory to have the laws related to the fundamental rights in place within three years since its promulgation. It also said the laws that contradict the constitution must be revised within a year since the first meeting of the federal parliament. The government prepared the laws within the deadline. However, since there is no such timeline for the promulgation of federal laws, successive governments have become negligent in having them in place.

As with the education Act, successive governments have also been reluctant to promulgate the Federal Civil Service Act, the absence of which has created problems for provincial governments to hire civil servants.

<P>  <h2 style="color: red; text-align: center;">RPP playing Hindu card to fulfil its agenda
 </h2>
        <img src="C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\CN4012\RPP flag.jpg"  width="400px" height="300px" style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
       
       <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 25px;"> KATHMANDU, JULY 21, Although the constitution of Nepal stipulates Nepal as a secular state, major political parties appear to be inclined towards Hindu politics with the exception of Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which openly advocates that the country ought to be a Hindu state. CPN-Maoist Centre supremo and Prime Minister Pushpa kamal Dahal's recent visit to India and the Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu is seen as evident signifiers of the ideological inclination of major political parties towards Hindu politics. Thus, it may be observed that Rastriya Prajatantra Party is not the only Hindu party for other political parties like the CPN-Maoist Centre and Nepali Congress may not be so far behind.Earlier, the controversy had flared up when PM Dahal visited Mahakaleshwar temple with his high level delegation comprising several cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat and Foreign Minister NP Saud during hisIndia visit. Before that, there was also the visit to Pashupatinath temple premises.
        Similarly, in April, during the three-day International Conference on Manaskhanda - a conference based on philosophy of Hinduism - the dignitaries were Nepali Congress lawmaker Arzu Rana Deuba and BJP's In Charge, Foreign Affairs, Vijay Chauthaiwale.And today, the RPP flaunted its identification with the Hindu identity. It played th Hindu card, probably a strategy to cash in on the sentiments of more than eighty per cent of the population, who are Hindus.The party took out a religious procession from Maitidevi to Pashupatinath temple today. Leaders and cadres of RPP gathered at Maitidevi temple and participated in a religious walk to Pashupatinath temple with holy water (Kalash).The procession was joined by RPP President Rajendra Lingden, leaders Rabindra Mishra, Deepak Bahadur Singh and other leaders and cadres as well as well-wishers and Hindu devotees.They chanted slogans about the importance of Hinduism.They chanted, "Hail Sanatan Hindu state, our country, our religion, more important than our lives."RPP leaders said the religious procession aimed to protect the country from imported religions, cultures and traditions, and bring together like-minded forces."We have planned to give continuity to such religious processions or campaigns nationally to educate the Nepali people about their religion," said RPP Chair Rajendra Lingden, "We have organised this religious procession to establish Nepal as Hindu state and make people more conscious about the significance of Hinduism."Similarly, RPP lawmaker Deepak Bahadur Singh said, "We have seen the likes of former PM Madhav Nepal as well as the current PM Dahal. It is clear why they have removed Hinduism from the constitution. Therefore, it is time to restore our own religion."Likewise, during the walk, when Rabindra Mishra was asked: How will Hindu state be restored? He said, "Hindu state is needed, otherwise, our religion, culture, and country will be ruined. Stop voting for 'unrighteous parties', the Hindu state will be restored.Hindu state will not be restored by saying Hindu state is needed and voting for a secularist party."Meanwhile, The United States' recent report on International Religious Freedom alleged that political parties of Nepal and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, could stand as threats to secularism as intolerance was growing.The report also alleged that the BJP and other Hindu groups in India are indirectly funding high profile politicians of major parties such as Rastriya Prajatantra Party to speak in favour of restoring Hindu state.Rastriya Prajatantra Party has termed the report of the US Department of State 'baseless'.Lingden had written to the US Ambassador to Nepal Dean R Thompson, saying, "The report contains baseless allegations against the RPP."
